# Impact of Medication on the Mucosal Microbiome in IBD

## Research Question
> "How does medication affect the microbiome of individuals with IBD: Crohn's Disease or Ulcerative Colitis?"

## Project Overview
This project utilizes the Ryan Dataset to analyze the spatial and pharmaceutical influences on the gut microbiome. We aim to isolate the effects of specific treatments (Anti-TNF and Mercaptopurine) compared to non-treated individuals and healthy controls, while accounting for the biopsy location as a key predictor.



## Current Status: Meeting Agenda & Action Items

## Data Processing Updates
- [ ] **DADA2 Denoising:** trucation parameters set to 220bp for both forward and reverse reads. Mean quality score began to decline at about 210bps for forward reads and reverse reads showing a more dramatic drop in quality score at about 170bps.

## Analysis (Parallel Tasks)

| Analysis Task | Lead | Objective |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Diversity Metrics** | Evelyn | Aim 1: Compare the diversity of the biopsy sites in healthy individuals. Aim 2: Analyze alpha and beta diversity metrics of medication use on inflamed vs. non-inflamed tissues. Bin together groups (medications or IBD types) with no distinguishable differences in diversity.|
| **Core Microbiome** | YunYun | Aim 3: Determine the compositional differences of the microbial communities in medicated vs non-medicated tissue samples of patients with IBD. Generate Venn diagrams for shared/unique taxa. |
| **Indicator Taxa** | Ahnaf | Aim 4: Identify indicator taxa significantly associated with inflammatory status and clinical metadata categories.|
| **DESeq2** | Hanna | Aim 5: Identify specific microbial taxa (ASVs) that are significantly increased or decreased in abundance across different tissue conditions and medication groups. |
| **PICRUSt2** | Keryanne | Aim 6: Determine the functional composition and metabolic pathway enrichment of microbial communities in IBD patients across medication groups. | 

## Action item deadlines: TBD during meeting.
