### Action items from previous meeting
* Find datasets looking at microbiome and anxiety or depressive disorders in mice, and send them to Evelyn.
* Make a list of possible research questions based on the datasets available on the course Canvas page.

### Datasets sourced by YunYun
* Inflammasome signaling affects anxiety- and depressive-like behavior and gut microbiome composition:

### Research questions from datasets available on Canvas
1. How does medication affect the microbiome of individuals with IBD, Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis? How are different parts of the colon affected? How does smoking contribute to bacterial diversity?
  * Dataset: IBD in Humans dataset, IBD_ryan (Dataset 16 on Canvas)
  * Metadata variables of interest: Gender, Condition, Biopsy_location, Histological_status, Medications, Smoking.status
  * Original paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15342-5#Sec2 (Focuses on the effects of inflammation and host epigenomics)
  * Related UJEMI paper: https://ojs.library.ubc.ca/index.php/UJEMI/article/view/199577 (Used a different dataset and focused on surgical intervention)
  * Pros:
    * Can be related to other studies
    * Many variables can be accounted for or looked into since nobody has used this dataset before.
  * Cons:
    * Similar question could have already be addressed in the literature
    * Only 343 samples (Is that too low? Or is that a normal sample size for this project?)
2. How does the microbiome affect the mental health of HIV-positive individuals?
  * Dataset: Depression dataset (Dataset 23 on Canvas)
  * Metadata variables of interest: many depression numeric measures, antiviral regimen, number of medications, lymphocyte, neutrophil
  * Original paper: https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/msystems.00465-20
  * Pros:
    * Lots of variables to look into
    * Lots of factors to look at depression rather than a yes or no or singular scale
    * Could use this dataset to compare the use of antiviral therapy in the HIV dataset (Dataset 20 on Canvas)
  * Cons:
    * Research question already answered in the original paper, so we would need to find a different question/perspective/focus.
      * Compared HIV and HCV infected and coinfected individuals and found that the gut microbiome differed between depression states only in coinfected individuals.
      * Maybe focusing solely on HIV infected individuals yield different results?
    * Unsure whether healthy individuals are included as a control in the dataset
